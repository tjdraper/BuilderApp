# 0.3.0

- Add custom single variable parsing (see Readme for use).
- Add custom variable pair parsing (see Readme for use).
- Moved primary application scripts into the "_libraries/app"" directory for easier future updating (just replace the whole _libraries folder, done). Index and build files in the root directory "probably" won't need updated very often (although a prettier build page is on the roadmap).
- Added demos of single and variable pair parsing in the index file.

# 0.2.1

- Output path on success/fail message now reflects from root instead of including "/pages/"

# 0.2.0

- Add parsing of {{meta_title}} variable.

# 0.1.1

- Fix a nasty bug where each subsequent page to be written would contain all the contents of the previous page.
- Move settings to settings.php so that base files can be replaced wholesale on update.


# 0.1.0

- Initial commit. App still in development. Let's see if anyone beats me up for this.
